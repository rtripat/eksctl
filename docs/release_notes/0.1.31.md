# Release 0.1.31

## Improvements

- upgrade `aws-iam-authenticator` to version 0.4.0 (#754):
    + old kubeconfig files may need updating - you may find `eksctl utils write-kubeconfig` handy
    + macOS: `homebrew/core/aws-iam-authenticator` is used from now on
- API version v1alpha5
  + Move SSH parameters under `ssh`; public keys can now be specified by local file, uploaded key in EC2 or by the key content (see `examples/07-ssh-keys.yaml` for detailed usage) (#673, #713)
  + rename `preBootstrapCommand` option in the config file has been renamed to `preBootstrapCommands` (#726)
  + `--dry-run=false` CLI argument has been renamed to `--approve` (#727)
- add support to attach target groups to node groups via ARNs (#746)
- add support for using config files in the drain command (#741)
- add support for using config files in the command for deleting node groups (#714)
- start using new `alpha.eksctl.io/` tag prefix (instead of `eksctl.cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1/`) (#728)
- ensure `ami: auto` (`--node-ami=auto`) searches official Amazon and Ubuntu AMIs by owner ID, to avoid security issue (#733)
